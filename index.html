            I Had to Choose.

            The blinking box effect, or being able to type. There is no easy way to have both.

            For now, the effect looks cooler.

            In the future, I may have time to implement both features.

                I'm a second-year Computing Security major at RIT.
                I'm looking for an internship or co-op during the fall of 2019.

            <h2>Who is he <i>really</i> ?</h2>
            <p>
                Hey, I'm Ethan! I'm a lighthearted guy that enjoys camping (In the woods, with the bears) and working with complex systems. I like to make systems run smoothly, and then I like to re-enforce them so that they stay that way under stress.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, my laptop runs Arch Linux. It took a long time to set up - but now it's my favorite machine to use. I keep backups in case anything goes wrong, and I keep it up-to-date to prevent things breaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Ironicaly, updating often causes things to break - but that's what makes it fun.)
            </p>
            <h2 title="Other than maintain my laptop">What do I do?</h2>
            <h3>Networks</h3>
            <p>
                Computers are cool, but connecting them together is where the real interesting things happen.
            </p>
            <h3>Web</h3>
            <p>
                I build small websites for fun (Like this one)! My resume is made with HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Woods</li>
                <li>With the Bears</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I love hiking. The less cell service, the better.
