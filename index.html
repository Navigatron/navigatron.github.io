			The blinking box effect, or being able to type. There is no easy way to have both.

			For now, the effect looks cooler.

			In the future, I may have time to implement both features.

			<h2>Who is he <i>really</i> ?</h2>
			<p>
				Hey, I'm Ethan! I enjoy camping (In the woods, with the bears) and working with complex systems. I like to make them run smoothly, and then bolster their defences so they stay that way.
			</p>
			<h2 title="Other than maintain my laptop">What do I do?</h2>
			<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
			<p>
				We expect our information systems to behave in certain ways - and yet, unlike physical objects or processes, we have no way of seeing what exactly is going on. Cybersecurity is, first and foremost, a visibility problem - to dig in under the hood; to find problems before attackers do; to continuously monitor systems to provide <i>assurance</i> that they are operating how we would like.
			</p>
			<h3>Consulting</h3>
			<p>
				Where cybersecurity is deeply technical, consulting is deeply <i>personal</i>. Where metal and electrons are deterministic (we think), humans are anything but. Consulting is the intersection of two opposing disciplines; to listen to and understand the needs of people and organizations, and to provide technical solutions to often qualitative problems.
			</p>
			<h3>Camping</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In the Woods</li>
				<li>With the Bears</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The less cell service, the better. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov">NY's Department of Environmental Conservation</a> - they maintain beautiful wilderness all over NY, where primitve camping is frequently allowed.
